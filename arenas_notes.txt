From Martins:
"you cannot exactly map reserve/commit concepts from windows to mmap, but as
long as you're ok relying on overcommit, most of the things will work fine -
allocate with prot_none, mprotect to r/w when needed, and use madvice with
MADV_DONTNEED or MADV_FREE to mark memory you won't need depending on what
behavior your want"
